          Return (Buy it again) is a research project designed for the
          experimental disclosure and artistic investigation of Amazon's return
          infrastructure. Most of the diffuse infrastructure remains hidden for
          the everyday consumer and even for the critical observer. Apart from
          huge Amazon warehouses located in more rural areas, which can
          sometimes be seen when traveling along motorways, or mostly anonymous
          parcel delivery services that move in white unlabelled vans, any
          physical instance remains hidden. Most of Amazon's services are
          outsourced to third party companies making it hard to track down the
          course of action and operation of the multinational company. While the
          Amazon universe stays hidden to us, our actions and preferences don't
          do so to the company. Handling our personal data is part of their
          business model – creating an information asymmetry, resulting in an
          imbalance of power between us, as a customer and them as our
          superviser. Our interest is to dissolve these roles and reveal the
          spatial workings of the company. This is why we set the goal to hunt
          down Amazon's infrastructure and decided to track and survey parcel
          movement with a simple but effective intervention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Within this intervention, we ordered GPS trackers from Amazon, charged
          and powered them on, while directly initiating the return process.
          Through the proxy API of the GPS device's manufacturer, we are able to
          track Amazon's infrastructure for roughly 30 days.
