            Return is a research project designed for the experimental
            disclosure and artistic investigation of Amazon's return
            infrastructure. Most of the diffuse infrastructure of the company
            remains hidden for the everyday consumer - and even for the critical
            observer. Apart from huge Amazon warehouses located in more rural
            areas, which can sometimes be perceived when travelling along
            motorways, the processes behind those physical instances remain
            veiled. Occasionally, by looking closely, one can recognise the
            mostly anonymous parcel delivery services that move in white,
            unlabelled vans in urban areas. Most of Amazon's services are
            outsourced to third party companies, making it hard to track down
            the course of action and operation of the multinational company. The
            incentive of the work is to dissolve these roles and reveal the
            spatial workings of the company.

            Within this intervention, we ordered GPS trackers from Amazon,
            charged and powered them on, while directly initiating the return
            process. Through the proxy API of the GPS device's manufacturer, we
            are able to track Amazon's infrastructure for roughly 40 days.
